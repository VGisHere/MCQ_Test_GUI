This GUI is primarily aimed for usage by UPSC aspirants. <br />
However, that said, it can _work with any PDF that contains Questions and Answers in split files_ and support for fetching the questions and answers can be integrated to source code.
<br />
# Current features of GUI include -
> 1. Attempt time based mock papers.
> 2. Add own comments (thought process) for question attempted.
> 3. Navigator for quick navigation between questions.
> 4. Save attempt data for future analysis.
> 5. View explanations of questions while analysing attempt.

<br />

## _Features in pipeline_ -
> 1. Support for Scanned PDF.
> 2. Support for single file for Questions and Answers.
> 3. Create .exe (and other respective extensions as per OS) for seamless experience.

Hope you find this useful for your mocks.
Wish you "**All the best!**" for your exam.
